"""Serve the whole shop system from ONE origin, the way production does.

In production every app sits under gervdalius-droid.github.io/<app>/, so they
share an origin — one localStorage, one Cache API, and iframes that can talk to
each other directly. Running each app on its own port during development breaks
all of that, and the bugs it hides only appear once deployed.

So this mounts them at the same paths GitHub Pages uses:

    /            → ~/github/hub          (this app)
    /shopflow/   → ~/shopflow
    /offer/      → ~/github/offer
    /invoices/   → ~/github/invoices
